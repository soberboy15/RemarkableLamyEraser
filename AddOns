Hello, 
I am new to GitHub. I was wondering if it would be possible to add possible options for a "highlighter" guick function via this hack.
Possibly a click to switch to highlighter or switch to last used writing utensil would be very useful. If possible, a hold to highlight function would be very usful as well...
Thank you for your contributions!
